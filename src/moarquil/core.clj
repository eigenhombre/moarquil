;; This animation project evolved over time as a way to learn Quil
;; better and to make a sort of immersive environment, reminiscent of
;; a "solar system" that one might explore in a space simulation game.
;; Also as an excuse to play with my random name generator
;; (`https://github.com/eigenhombre/namejen`).

;; Some screenshots taken while developing the program can be found at
;; `http://parentheticalworlds.tumblr.com`.

;; To run the program, first run `lein Ã¼berjar`, then:

;; `java -jar target/moarquil.jar`.

;; More about this project at `https://github.com/eigenhombre/moarquil`.
